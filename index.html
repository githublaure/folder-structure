          <h2> The phenomenon of women and men in chess, why so much disparity?</h2>
          <h3>Why have so few females achieved the pinnacle of chess excellence and become Grandmasters?</h3>
          <p>
            However, due to a lack of role models and few opportunities to compete on the same level as boys, there is a disproportionately low number of female Grandmasters in the world of chess. 
            This is not a reflection of intelligence, but a consequence of societal norms that have discouraged many girls from pursuing the game.

            
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the efforts of many organizations to create more equitable opportunities for girls in chess, the gender disparity among Grandmasters remains an issue that needs to be addressed.
            In order to reduce the gender disparity among Grandmasters, organizations should work to create equitable opportunities for girls to pursue chess. 
           <p> This could include providing access to free or low-cost chess training, mentorship programs, 
            and competitions, as well as encouraging positive representation of female players in media. </p>
           <p>Additionally, parents and educators should be encouraged to foster a supportive environment for girls to explore chess and to provide them with the resources and support they need to succeed.</p>
